# Python_Coding 🐍

A collection of Python programs built as part of my learning journey.

This repository contains practice scripts, mini-projects, and concept-based implementations that help me strengthen my understanding of Python fundamentals and problem-solving.

## 📌 About This Repository

This repo is my structured Python practice space where I:

- Build small utility programs
- Apply core programming concepts
- Practice input validation and logic building
- Improve problem-solving skills
- Experiment with real-world scenarios

New programs will be added regularly as I continue learning.

## 📂 Current Programs

- `calculator.py`  
  Performs basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).

- `temp_conversion.py`  
  Converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

- `weight_conversion.py`  
  Converts weight between kilograms and pounds.

- `madlibs_game.py`  
  A simple interactive word game using formatted strings.

- `compound_interest_calc.py`  
  Calculates compound interest with proper input validation.

- `countdown_timer.py`  
  A countdown timer that displays hours, minutes, and seconds using time-based execution.
